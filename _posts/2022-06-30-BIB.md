As an undergraduate, I started my first research using _Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM)_ with Chaebin Yoo under the guidance of Dr. Justin Minue Kim. 
It was very lucky to see our project turning into a form of academic paper. 


In this study, we built a data-driven model to predict individuals' **trait anxiety** with **structural connectivity** (i.e., fractional anisotropy of the white matter). 
The whole-brain predictive network was strikingly different across age groups: 
  - a negative network (largely overlapping with the amygdala-prefrontal circuitry) linked with higher trait anxiety in young adults (20-30 years of age)

    </p>
  - a distrubited network of positive connectivities predicing higher trait anxiety in the full sample (20-80 years of age).

These findings complement the inconsistencies existing in the field, implicating the importance of age factor in relevant studies.
