title: "poster presentation at 2023 Developmental Affective Neuroscience Symposium!"

[**2023 Developmental Affective Neuroscience Symposium (DANS)**][https://www.dans.pitt.edu/] was truly an eye-opening conference! Full of inspiring talks and discussions on the this year's theme 'Neurodevelopment of Regulatory Systems: A Focus on Emotion and Motivation'!
Chaebin and I _together_ presented our recent project using normative modeling where we suggested potential moderating effect of age in the relationship between structure-function maturation. 
We were very lucky to meet all the brilliant people at Pittsburgh painted yellow and orange at the end of the autumn!
