title: "poster presentation at the Social Affective Neuroscience Society!"
---

**2023 Social Affective Neuroscience Society (SANS)** was held at beautiful Santa Barbara, CA, from April 27-29 and I had the opportunity to present my recent work! 
It was full of truly delightful moments to admire, share my passion, and be indulged in the feeling of being part of the academia.
Visiting the University of Denver was also another unforgettable memory which led me to think more deeply about the impact and translations of environmental effects.
Overall, in many ways, I couldn't think of a better chance to experience such inspiring culture as a proud first-timer. 

See you around SANS!
