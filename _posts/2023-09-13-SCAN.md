Officially out! 


My first-authored paper on the investigation of neurodevelopmental measures and grit has been published at Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. 


**One-line summary**:  <span style='color: Peru;'> Gritty teenagers seem to show more mature functional connectome architecture! </span>  


In this paper, I used two proxies for neurodevelopment - _functional connectome stability and similarity_ - and linked these with grit in the developing sample (the Healthy Brain Network dataset, 11-19 years, N = 64). _Inter-subject Representational Similarity (IS-RSA)_ was another core methodology that confirmed the main findings. 

I was extremly fortunate to have two supervisors, Professor Dauen Park and Professor Justin Minue Kim who shared their expertise in every way that I can think of. Take a deeper look at [Park, Park & Kim (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsad047/7272592?searchresult=1)!
