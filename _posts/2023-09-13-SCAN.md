title: "Park, Park & Kim (2023) is officially published at Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience"
---

Officially out! My first-authored paper on the investigation of neurodevelopmental measures and grit has been published at Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. One-line summary: **Gritty teenagers** seem to show more **mature functional connectome architecture**! In this paper, I used two proxies for neurodevelopment - _functional connectome stability and similarity_ - and linked these with grit in the developing sample (the Healthy Brain Network dataset, 11-19 years, N = 64). _Inter-subject Representational Similarity (IS-RSA)_ was another core methodology that confirmed the main findings. Take a deeper look at [Park, Park & Kim (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsad047/7272592?searchresult=1)!
