I am currently a graduate student in the [Human Affective Neuroscience (HumAN) Lab](https://www.affectiveneurosciencelab.com/home) under the direction of Dr. Justin Minue Kim at Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea. From this fall, I will be joining the Cognitive Science department at UC San Diego as a Ph.D. student.
I am particularly interested in using neuroimaging methods that can explain and predict **developmental trajectories** and **how our brain changes** across the life span. 
You can take a look at the details of my research aims below! 


### Research Interest
- predicting developmental outcomes
- neuroplasticity
- mental health and clinical disorders
- environmental effects on the developing brain
- finding biomarkers
- translations of scientific research into real-life and policies
