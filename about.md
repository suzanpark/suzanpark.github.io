I am a graduate student studying neuroscience at Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea. 
I am particularly interested in using neuroimaging methods that can explain and predict **developmental trajectories** and **how our brain changes** across the life span. 
You can take a look at the details of my research aims below! 


### Research Interest
- predicting developmental outcomes
- experience-dependent neural changes 
- mental health and well-being
- environmental effects on the developing brain
