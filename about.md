I am an incoming Cognitive Science Ph.D. student in [Greene Lab](https://greenelab.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. I am particularly interested in using neuroimaging methods that can explain and predict **developmental trajectories** and **how our brain changes** across the life span. My research mainly focuses on fMRI and data-driven methodologies. Before joining Greene Lab, I studied cognitive neuroscience in [Human Affective Neuroscience (HumAN) Lab](https://www.affectiveneurosciencelab.com/home) at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. 


### Research Interest
- predicting developmental outcomes
- neuroplasticity
- mental health and clinical disorders
- environmental effects on the developing brain
- finding biomarkers
- translations of scientific research into real-life and policies
