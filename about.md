I am a graduate student in the [Human Affective Neuroscience (HumAN) Lab](https://www.affectiveneurosciencelab.com/home) under the direction of Dr. Justin Minue Kim at Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea. 
I am particularly interested in using neuroimaging methods that can explain and predict **developmental trajectories** and **how our brain changes** across the life span. 
You can take a look at the details of my research aims below! 


### Research Interest
- predicting developmental outcomes
- experience-dependent neural changes (e.g., early-life stress and family environment)
- mental health and well-being
- environmental effects on the developing brain
- socioemotional development
- translations of scientific research into real-life and policies
